# Java Launcher Code Examples

### GitHub repo: [code-examples-java](./README.md)

This GitHub repo includes code examples for the DocuSign Admin API, Click API, eSignature REST API, Monitor API, and Rooms API.


## Introduction

This repo is a Java Spring Boot application that supports the following authentication workflows:

* Authentication with DocuSign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.

* Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

The [Spring Boot security Oauth2 boot autoconfigure package](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth2-boot/blob/master/spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/oauth2/resource/UserInfoRestTemplateCustomizer.java) is used for authentication.

The OAuth library is used in the file [WebSecurityConfig.java](https://github.com/docusign/code-examples-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/docusign/WebSecurityConfig.java).


## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth#required-scopes).  

For a list of code examples that use the eSignature API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Rooms API 

**Note:** To use the Rooms API, you must also [create your Rooms developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/rooms101/create-account). Examples 4 and 6 require that you have the DocuSign Forms feature enabled in your Rooms for Real Estate account.  
For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the Rooms API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/rooms101/auth/).  

For a list of code examples that use the Rooms API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Click API  
For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the Click API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/click101/auth/#required-scopes)  

For a list of code examples that use the Click API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Monitor API

**Note:** To use the Monitor API, you must also [enable DocuSign Monitor for your organization](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/monitor-api/how-to/enable-monitor/).  

For information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the Monitor API, see the [scopes section](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/monitor-api/monitor101/auth/). 

For a list of code examples that use the Monitor API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/monitor-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Admin API

**Note:** To use the Admin API, you must [create an organization](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/org-admin-guide-create-org) in your DocuSign developer account. Also, to run the DocuSign CLM code example, [CLM must be enabled for your organization](https://support.docusign.com/en/articles/DocuSign-and-SpringCM).

For information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the Admin API, see the [scopes section](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/admin-api/admin101/auth/).

For a list of code examples that use the Admin API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/admin-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Web Forms API

The Web Forms API is available in all developer accounts, but only in certain production account plans. Contact [DocuSign Support](https://support.docusign.com/) or your account manager to find out whether the Web Forms API is available for your production account plan.

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the Rooms API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/web-forms-api/plan-integration/authentication/).

For a list of code examples that use the Web Forms API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/web-forms-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/) authentication.

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.  
   
   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.  

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the User ID GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.  

   For both authentication flows:  
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include redirect URIs of     

   * http://localhost:8080/login&type=acg
   * http://localhost:8080/login&type=jwt

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as   
   
   {base_url}/login
   
   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.  

1. Download [JDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11) or later and extract to C:\Program Files\Java
1. Download [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and extract to C:
   * Follow these [instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to add both Java and Maven to the `PATH` environment variable.
1. [Git Bash command line](https://gitforwindows.org/), macOS Terminal, or Linux shell


### Installation steps

**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip step 4 as it was automatically performed for you.

1. Extract the Quickstart ZIP file or download or clone the code-examples-java repository.
1. In your command-line environment, switch to the :  
   `cd <Quickstart >` or `cd code-examples-java`
